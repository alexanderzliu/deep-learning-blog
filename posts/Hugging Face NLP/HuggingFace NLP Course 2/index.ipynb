This is done by converting our input into tokens, which are partitions of our input that we have a few ways of implementing. These tokens each have a numerical ID, which will each be represented by our 'hidden size'-sized vector for our model to ingest. \n",

Since each word is a token, our vocabulary (the total set of tokens we have IDs for) must be large to account for all of the different words that might be in our input. Since each of these will then be represented by a vector that might be hundreds of numbers long, the model's representation of an input could becoming overwhelmingly large quickly. Additionally, we'll have an \"UNKNOWN\" token ID, assigned to every word that isn't in our vocabulary. So we might also lose a lot of information if our vocabulary isn't sufficiently comprehensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Character - All characters (like letters) in a language become a token. Usually results in a smaller necessary vocabulary (although character-based languages like Chinese can still have large vocabularies). Issues arise since characters hold less semantic information than words. Additionally, this approach translates to longer token ID strings compared to word-based tokenization, introducing limitations to the length of sequences that can be processed.\n",

    "Subword - A balance between character and word based tokenization. Complex words can be split into meaningful components as necessary, like how the -s or -es suffix indicates plurality in English, while common words can be efficiently represented with a single token ID. Because words are split up, we also have a special token indicating the start of new words. "
