    "text": "Okay let’s go finally learning about what everyone want’s to know about when learning about AI and Machine Learning: stochastic gradient descent.\nThe first two lesson’s of this course had us familiarize ourselves with what a deep learning application looks like without really getting into any of the theory or inner workings. We used the fastai library that provides a layer of abstraction for the techniques used in fine-tuning and training models (as it should). Now we get into components of machine learning that so many other MOOCs start with right off the bat - loss functions and gradient descent. It was only inevitable.\nAnyways, let’s get on with the notebook. The example we’re working through is an image classification model that can classify any image as a 3 or a 7. Or you could just go on r/truerateme for that.\n\n1 + 1\nprint([i for i in 'hi bebi'])\nprint('hello bebi')\n\n['h', 'i', ' ', 'b', 'e', 'b', 'i']\nhello bebi"
